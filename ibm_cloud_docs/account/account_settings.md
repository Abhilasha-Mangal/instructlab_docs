We're sad to see you go! If there's any way we can assist you before you decide to close your account, [reach out to us](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

* To close a Lite account, go to **Manage** > **Account**, select **Account settings** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. From the account settings page, click **Close account**. You can reactivate your account if you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. After an account is closed for 30 days, all data is deleted and all services are removed.
* If you want to close a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, contact [Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter). A support case is required for account security and documentation purposes. After your Pay-As-You-Go account is closed, all usage is stopped across all services running in your account, and the usage that is accrued in the current billing period is sent in one final invoice at the close of the billing period. Closing your account can't be undone and your data is unrecoverable.
