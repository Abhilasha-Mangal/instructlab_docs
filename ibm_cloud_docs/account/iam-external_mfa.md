# Ordering external authentication MFA for a user
{: #external}

As a master user of a legacy classic infrastructure account, you can order external authentication and enable the multifactor authentication (MFA) option for a user's login. You are charged a monthly fee for the external authentication option.
{: shortdesc}

Unlike ID-based MFA, external authentication is account-based and require MFA for the user's login only for the account where the setting is enabled. For more information, see [Types of multifactor authentication](/docs/account?topic=account-types).

As of 27 May 2021, phone-based authentication is deprecated. Any related billing for previously set up phone-based authentication is removed for all users in the account, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} replaces this feature with Symantec. To set up your account to use Symantec, complete the following steps.
