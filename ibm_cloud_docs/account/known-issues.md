# Known issues and limitations
{: #known-issues}

Known issues and limitations include not being able to restrict access to some products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, the maximum limits for creating {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources, and not being able to delete users from accounts that have too many Cloud Foundry orgs.
{: shortdesc}


## Catalog management settings don't apply to some {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} products
{: #settings-noapply}

Some products are not affected by the following catalog visibility settings:

- Turning off the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog
- Excluding all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} products from the catalog
- Excluding all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} products from your private catalogs

You can view and manage catalog visibility settings by going to **Manage > Catalogs > Settings** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.
{: note}

Users can still create instances of the following products by using an API or the CLI, regardless of the catalog visibility setting in the account or private catalog:

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM limits
{: #iam_limits}

The following table lists the maximum limits for IAM resources. These limits apply to any user who can create IAM resources. If a limit is exceeded, you receive an exception and are not allowed to create any new resources beyond that limit.

If you have a specific use case that requires an extended limit, you can request an increase. For more information, see [Increasing account limits](/docs/account?topic=account-account-limits).
{: note}

| Resource                               | Max  |
|----------------------------------------|------|
| Access groups per account              | 500  |
| Access groups per user                 | 50   |

{: caption="Table 1. IAM account limits" caption-side="top"}

[^tabletext]: IAM policies and context-based restrictions rules share a combined limit of 4020.

A maximum of 1,000 policies and service to service authorizations within one account is recommended to ensure optimal performance within your account. For more information about limiting the number of policies in your account, see the [Best practices for organizing resources and assigning access](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup).
{: tip}

If you want to check the number of policies in your account, see [Viewing the total number of policies per account](/docs/account?topic=account-account-limits&interface=cli#total-number-policies-cli). To request an increase in the account limit, see [Requesting a policy and rule shared limit increase](/docs/account?topic=account-account-limits&interface=cli#limit-increase).

### Policy limitations based on attributes
{: #access-tag-limits}

Access management tags are only available when you create an access policy that is scoped for all IAM-enabled services. In this case, when you enable the access based on tags, no other attributes can be added. And, when you base your policy on a specific location or resource group, no tag can be added to the access policy.

### Trusted profile limitations
{: #tp-limits}

Users can't use the Support Center when they log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by applying a trusted profile.

## Context-based restrictions limits
{: #cbr-limits}

The following table lists the maximum limits for context-based restrictions. These limits apply to any user who can create context-based restrictions rules or network zones. For more information, see [What are context-based restrictions?](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis).

If you have a specific use case that requires an extended limit, you can request an increase. For more information, see [Increasing account limits](/docs/account?topic=account-account-limits).
{: note}

| Resource                               | Max  |
|----------------------------------------|------|
| Context-based restriction rules per account [^tabletext2] | 4020 |
| Network zones per account              | 500 |
| IP addresses per network zone              | 1000 |
| IP addresses per rule             | 1000 |
{: caption="Table 2. Context-based restrictions limits" caption-side="top"}

[^tabletext2]: IAM policies and context-based restrictions rules share a combined limit of 4020.

A context-based restriction rule that includes multiple network zones can have a maximum of 1000 IP addresses indirectly associated with it. For example, in a rule that includes two network zones, one of the zones could have 800 IP addresses and the other could have a maximum of 200 IP addresses.
{: note}

If you want to check the number of rules in your account, see [Viewing the total number of rules per account](/docs/account?topic=account-account-limits&interface=cli#total-number-rules-cli). To request an increase in the account limit, see [Requesting a policy and rule shared limit increase](/docs/account?topic=account-account-limits&interface=cli#limit-increase).

### Eventual consistency
{: #cbr-eventual-consistency}

Context-based restrictions follow an [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency){: external} pattern that is common to many cloud-native services. As a result, Context-based restrictions remain highly available and performant across multiple global regions. Changes that are made to Context-based restrictions rules and network zones are recorded and propagated worldwide. Access changes might not take effect until the propagation process is complete, usually within a few minutes.

## Access policy version limitations
{: #policy-version-limit}

As of 25 January 2023, IAM supports two versions of the IAM Policy Management API: `/v2/policies` and `/v1/policies`. `v1/polices` allows for string comparisons against attributes in the subject and resources of a policy. `v2/polices` introduces a new schema that provides backwards functional compatibility while allowing for more complex comparisons and operators.

### String comparisons
{: #policy-string-comparison}

The following table lists the string comparison operators that you can use to build access policies with `/v2/policies` syntax. For more information about each version, see [Comparing `/v1/policies` and `/v2/policies` syntax](/docs/account?topic=account-known-issues#compare-syntax).

| Operator   | Description  |
|------------|--------------|
| `stringEquals`  | Case-sensitive string comparison. Boolean or number values are converted into a string before comparison. |
| `stringMatch`  | Case-sensitive string match is performed between the pattern and the target string by using either an asterisk (`*`), question mark (`?`), or both. An asterisk (`*`) represents any sequence of zero or more characters in the string, and a question mark (`?`) represents any single character. |
| `stringExists`  | String must be present but can have any none zero value. |
{: caption="Table 5. The string comparison operators available for conditions in access policies." caption-side="top"}

For example, the following statement contains an `operator` element that uses `stringEquals` to specify that the account ID and service name must exactly match the `value` element. The statement also contains an `operator` element that uses `stringMatch` to specify a naming pattern for {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} topics that you might use to organize access to those specific resources. This way, you can assign one policy to all topics in your account that begin with `messagehub-topic-dev`.

```json
"resource": {
		"attributes": [
			{
				"operator": "stringEquals",
				"value": "0aeab68aabd14d89bd72e4330150710a0",
				"key": "accountId"
			},
			{
				"value": "messagehub",
				"operator": "stringEquals",
				"key": "serviceName"
			},
			{
				"value": "messagehub-topic-dev*",
				"operator": "stringMatch",
				"key": "resource"
			}
		]
	},
```
{: codeblock}

[Authorization policies](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth) are currently only supported in `/v1/policies`.
{: note}

### Checking a policy version in the console
{: #check-policy-version}

Time-based conditions for IAM access policies use `/v2/policies` syntax. Policies that use `/v1/policies` syntax aren't eligible to add time-based conditions. To check whether you can add time-based conditions to an existing policy in the console, complete the following steps.

1. Go to **Manage > Access (IAM)**.
1. Select **Users**, **Trusted profiles**, **Service IDs**, or **Access groups**, depending on the policy you want to check.
1. Select a specific users, trusted profile, service ID, or access group.
1. Go to **Access** > **Access policies**.
1. Click on a policy. `/v1/policies` are indicated by the following notification:

   > Conditions unavailable for v1 policies

1. (Optional) To add conditions to a policy that uses /v1/policies syntax, delete the original policy and create a new one. In the console, new policies use /v2/policies syntax.

### Comparing `/v1/policies` and `/v2/policies` syntax
{: #compare-syntax}

The policy in each example grants a user access to the Billing service with the Editor role. The `/v2/policies` example includes temporary time-based conditions, indicated by the `"conditions"` parameter.

When editing, creating, and deleting policies, use the corresponding API version.
{: tip}

#### `/v1/policies`
{: #v1-policies}

```json
{
	"type": "access",
	"roles": [
		{
			"role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor"
		}
	],
	"resources": [
		{
			"attributes": [
				{
					"name": "accountId",
					"value": "000c49bc2724a07000010b1da94c4d0"
				},
				{
					"name": "serviceName",
					"value": "billing"
				}
			]
		}
	],
	"subjects": [
		{
			"attributes": [
				{
					"name": "iam_id",
					"value": "IBMid-00000AV0S0"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```
{: codeblock}

When you list policies with `/v1/policies` the API returns `/v1/` and a placeholder policy for each `/v2/` policy that's in the account. For more information, see [`/v1/policies` returns a placeholder for `/v2/` policies the account](/docs/account?topic=account-known-issues#placeholder-v2)
{: note}


#### `/v2/policies`
{: #v2-policies}

```json
{
	"type": "access",
	"control": {
		"grant": {
			"roles": [
				{
					"role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor"
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"resource": {

			}
		]
	},

			},
			{
				"key": "{{environment.attributes.current_date_time}}",
				"operator": "dateTimeLessThanOrEquals",
				"value": "2023-01-06T17:59:59+00:00"
			}
		]
	},
	"pattern": "time-based-conditions:once",
	"subject": {
		"attributes": [
			{
				"key": "iam_id",
				"operator": "stringEquals",
				"value": "IBMid-00000AV0S0"
			}
		]
	}
}
```
{: codeblock}

#### `/v1/policies` returns a placeholder for `/v2/` policies
{: #placeholder-v2}

When you list policies with `/v1/policies` the API returns `/v1/` and a placeholder policy for each `/v2/` policy that's in the account. The placeholders indicate the existence of additional policies in the account while abiding by the `/v1/` schema. To see the full content of a `/v2/` policy, list policies by using `/v2/policies` or retrieve the individual policy by using `GET: v2/policies/<ID>`. For example, see the following placeholder policy:

```json
{
    "id": "33b901fa-8ec5-4432-a2e6-24b6a212c20a",
	"type": "access",
	"description": "**This is a unsupported policy version placeholder, to view the full content, please call GET with provided href**",
	"subjects": [{
		"attributes": [{
			"name": "iam_id",
			"value": "unsupported version"
		}]
	}],
	"roles": [{
		"role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:UnsupportedVersion",
		"display_name": "Unsupported Version",
		"description": "**This is a unsupported policy version placeholder, to view the full content, please call GET with provided href**"
	}],
	"resources": [{
		"attributes": [{
			"name": "accountId",
			"value": "000c49bc2724a07000010b1da94c4d0"
		}]
	}],
    "href": "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/v2/policies/88b901fa-6ec5-888-a2e6-24b6a212c20a"
}
