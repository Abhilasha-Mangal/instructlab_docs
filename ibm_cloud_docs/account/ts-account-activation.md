# Why didnâ€™t I receive the confirmation email for creating my account?
{: #ts_email}
{: troubleshoot}

I didn't receive a confirmation email for successful account creation.
{: shortdesc}

You didn't receive the confirmation email to activate your account.
{: tsSymptoms}

Your email client or email server might be blocking the email.
{: tsCauses}

Check your inbox and your spam folder for the email. The confirmation email is sent from the `ibmacct@iam.ibm.com` email address, and the subject begins with "Action Required!"
{: tsResolve}

* Check for filters or settings in your email program that delete email or route email to a location other than your inbox.
* Make sure that your spam filter or security software is allowing emails with links through to your email address.
* Contact your email provider or administrator to ask them to check for any configuration that blocks email from `ibmacct@iam.ibm.com`.

After you unblock the confirmation email, go to the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console](/){: external} and log in. Click **Resend** to send another confirmation email to the email address that is associated with your IBMid.

If you still can't activate your account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar).
