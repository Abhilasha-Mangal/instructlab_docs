# Defining your product details
{: #cm-catalog-details}

When you publish your product to the catalog, users with access to your private catalog can view a tile with the product name, logo, and other details that you add during onboarding. To help users easily find your product in the catalog, you can specify specific keywords and filters that apply to your product.

## Providing catalog entry details
{: #cm-catalog-entry}

Complete the following steps to define or update your catalog entry details. A catalog entry is displayed as a tile in the catalog that shows a title, short description, common filters, and a logo. Additionally, the filters and keywords that you define enable users to quickly locate your catalog entry.

1. Click **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Private catalogs** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console.
1. Click the name of the private catalog that contains the product that you want to add details for.
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Edit** in the row that contains the product.
1. In the Catalog entry details section, click **Edit** to add or update any of the following items:

   Product name
   :   Add a name for your product

   Programmatic name
   :   This name is automatically generated based on your product's name that you imported to your private catalog. It is used when managing your product in the CLI or API.

   Short description
   :   Provide a short description to help users learn about and evaluate your product quickly from the tile in the catalog.

   Category
   :   Select a category. This is a required field that you set during initial onboarding, but can change if needed. You can find all of the available category values by using the [`ibmcloud catalog offering category-options`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-catalogs-plugin#category-options-offering) command.

   Filters
   :   Choose from the set of filters on compliance, delivery method, deployment target, pricing plan, and more. These filters are used to help users quickly find products relevant to their business needs.

   Industry
   :   Add up to five industry filters to target your product to specific users.

   Keywords
   :   Provide relevant keywords that enable your product to appear in search results when users search for the product.

   Logo URL
   :   Make sure that your product or company logo image is an SVG or PNG file that's a square image roughly sized at 32 x 32 pixels and does not appear blurry or pixelated.

   Documentation URL
   :   Add a link to your product's public documentation.

   Provider name
   :   Users can filter the catalog by the provider of a product. When you onboard a product to a private catalog, the provider name is set to `Community` by default. However, you can customize this field to display your company or organization name.

   The preview of your catalog entry updates in real time as you make changes to the fields that display in the catalog entry, such as the product name, short description, and logo.
