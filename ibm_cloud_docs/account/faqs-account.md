{: shortdesc}

## How do I create an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account?
{: #create-account}
{: faq}

You can create an account by [registering](/registration){: external} your email address. For identity verification, a credit card is required when you create a new account.

Feature codes aren't supported in some countries. For more information, see [personal use availability](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#signup-personalaccts).

## Why is my credit card not authorized when I am creating an account?
{: #authorize-account}
{: faq}

A credit card is required to create a new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account unless you have a subscription or feature code. In many cases, a credit card isn't accepted because your credit card issuer didn't authorize it. For more information about issues with credit card authorization, see [Credit Card error messages](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cc-error-messages).


## How do I get help with issues with creating an account?

## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}
{: faq}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges.

You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-liteaccount).

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}

There's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.

If you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.


## What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.

You can check your usage by going to **Manage** > **Billing and usage** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and selecting **Usage**. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage).

For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

## What access is required to create access management tags?
{: #permissions-create-access-tags}
{: faq}

You must be the account owner or have the following roles:

* Administrator on all account management services
* Administrator on the tagging service

For more information, see [Granting users access to tag resources](/docs/account?topic=account-access).

## What access is required to attach or detach tags?
{: #permissions-add-remove-resource-tags}
{: faq}

* To manage user tags on a resource, you must have at least the editor role for IAM-enabled resources or the developer role in a Cloud Foundry space.

## Can I delete my tags?
{: #delete-tag}
{: faq}

Before you can delete a tag, you must detach it from all resources. The tag might be attached to a resource that you don't have permission to view. The same tag can be attached to several resources by different users in the same billing account. Users don't have the same visibility on all resources on the account. Contact the account owner who can resolve the problem by detaching the tag from the blocking resource.

If you still can't delete it, the tag might be attached to a reclaimed resource. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI to manage the reclamation process of specific resources. For more information, see [Using resource reclamations](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation).

When you delete an access management tag from the account, any associated IAM policies are also deleted with it.
