# Enabling one-time passcode MFA for a user
{: #totp}

As an Administrator on the IAM Identity Service or All IAM Account Management service, you can enable the multifactor authentication (MFA) option that prompts a user for a time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) at login. This type of legacy account-based MFA is required only for the account where the setting is enabled and is available only for accounts with classic infrastructure.
{: shortdesc}

For more information about your MFA options, see [Types of multifactor authentication](/docs/account?topic=account-types).

## Before you begin
{: #totp-access}

If you have any of the following access, you can update this setting for other users in your account:

* Administrator on the IAM Identity Service or All IAM Account Management services
* You are an ancestor in the classic infrastructure hierarchy for the user and you have the Manage users classic infrastructure permission assigned

To turn on this MFA option for a user, they must first set up TOTP. For more information, see [Setting up TOTP](/docs/account?topic=account-totp#totp-setup).
{: important}

## Setting up TOTP
{: #totp-setup}

Users can set up TOTP for extra authentication at login. You must set up your TOTP before you or administrator can enable this MFA requirement for you.

2. In the Time-based one-time passcode authentication seciton, click **Set up**.
3. Scan the QR code with an authentication app on your device.
4. Click **OK** when you're finished.

To remove your TOTP, click **Remove**.
