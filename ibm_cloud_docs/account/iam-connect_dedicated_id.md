# Connecting a dedicated ID to your public IBMid
{: #connect_dedicated_id}

To log in to a dedicated cloud where a public IAM service is available, you must log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI with your public IBMid instead of the dedicated ID.
{: shortdesc}

```text
$ ibmcloud login -a https://api.{dedicated_env}.cloud.ibm.com
API endpoint: https://api.{dedicated_env}.cloud.ibm.com

Public IAM token service is available in the dedicated environment.
Log in with your public IBMid, or use '--no-iam' to log in as a dedicated user only.

Email>
```

If your dedicated ID is already connected to the public IBMid, it authenticates and logs in:

```text
Authenticating...
OK

Connected to dedicated user my_dedicated_id
```

However, if your dedicated ID is not connected to the public IBMid, you are prompted to manually connect to the public IBMid:

```text
You are logging with an IBMid that isn't associated with any dedicated user.
To set up the connection, input the credentials of the dedicated user.

Choose a credential type:
1. User name and password
2. One-time code. You can get one at https://login.{dedicated_env}.cloud.ibm.com/passcode)
Enter a number>
```

Select an option to input the credentials for the dedicated ID. After successful authentication, your dedicated ID is connected to your public IBMid.

## Force logging in to local UAA server
{: #force_login}

To force logging in to the UAA server with a dedicated ID, specify the `--no-iam` option in `ibmcloud login` command:

```text
ibmcloud login --no-iam
```

## Disconnect your dedicated ID from the public IBMid
{: #disconnect_id}

You can use `ibmcloud iam dedicated-id-disconnect` to disconnect public IBMid with connected dedicated ID.

```text
$ ibmcloud iam dedicated-id-disconnect
Do you really want to disconnect my_dedicated_id from public IBMid? (Y/N)> y
Disconnecting dedicated user my_dedicated_id from public IBMid...
OK

Logging out...
OK
```
