# Monitoring login sessions
{: #end-user-sessions}

You can review, manage, and revoke your user's active login sessions. You might want to end a session if a login-related credential, such as a refresh token or an IAM cookie is compromised. You can end the active login session that's associated with that credential.

If you are the account owner or assigned the administrator role for the IAM Identity service, you can update the login session settings for all user sessions in the account. For more information about configuring the settings, see [Managing user login sessions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-work-sessions).
