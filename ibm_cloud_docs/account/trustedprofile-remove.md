# Removing trusted profiles
{: #trusted-profile-remove}

When you remove trusted profiles, compute resources and federated users are unlinked from the profile and can no longer apply the trusted profile identity.
{: shortdesc}

To remove trusted profiles, you must be assigned the administrator or operator role within the account, or on the IAM Identity Service. 

When you remove trusted profiles, you revoke all active sessions. Users are immediately logged out and the removed profiles are no longer available to connect to the target account. API calls that use access tokens might be successful until the access token expires. 
{: note}
