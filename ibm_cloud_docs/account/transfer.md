# Transferring ownership of your account
{: #transfer}

You can transfer your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account to a different owner by creating a support case with information about the new owner. You can transfer only Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts.
{: shortdesc}

Every {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account must have a valid account owner. Accounts without a valid account owner are subject to suspension and possible termination.
{: note}

## Transferring an account that you own
{: #transfer-own}

As the account owner, you can transfer your account to a new owner by creating a support case. The new owner must be an existing user within the account. If the person that you want to own the account isn't an existing user, [invite them to the account](/docs/account?topic=account-iamuserinv) before you create the support case.

To create the support case, click the **Help** icon ![Help icon](../icons/help.svg "Help") > **Support center** from the console menu bar, and click **Create a case**. In the case description, include the full name and IBMid of the user that is to be the new account owner.

When you transfer your account to a new owner, be aware that you as the previous account owner will be automatically removed from that account. The new owner needs to invite the account's previous owner back to the transferred account to keep them within it.
{: note}

## Transferring an account from another owner
{: #transfer-lost}

If the owner of an account left your company and you need to transfer the account, you must choose a new owner and then create a support case to request a transfer.

The new owner must be a user in the account and can't be the owner of another {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If the user isn't in the account, another user can invite them to the account or you can request to add them to the account in the support case that you create.

In the support case to request an account transfer, you must attach an official document from your company that contains the following information.
- Your official company letterhead
- Your company's article of incorporation, if applicable
- A statement that the individual is no longer associated with your company
- An explanation that you want the account owner to be changed to a new owner
- The given name and surname of the new account owner
- The email address and phone number of the new account owner
- A signature of an executive at your company
- The account number of the account to transfer

   When you're logged in to the account, you can find the account number in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} menu bar next to the account name. For example, you might see `1234567 - IBM`, where the account number is 1234567.
